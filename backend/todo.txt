### Task 1: Improve Session Handling with Summary Storage
    * When a new message comes from a user:

        * Check if they already have a session.
        * If not, try to load their last summary from MongoDB.
        * If found → create a session with that summary.
        * If not → start a new empty session.

    * While the session is active:

        * Track the user's chat messages and token usage.
        * Update their (lastActive) time.

    * Every few minutes:

        * Find sessions that have been inactive for over 30 minutes.
        * For those sessions:

            * Summarize the chat history using AI.
            * Save the summary + token counts to MongoDB.
            * Delete the session from memory.

    * When that user sends a message again:

        * Check MongoDB for the saved summary.
        * Use it to restore their session and continue the conversation.

### Task 2: Reorder Async Workflow for Faster User Response

    * When a new user message is received:

        * Immediately generate and send the AI reply to the user .
        * Do not waitfor session updates or logging before responding.

    * After sending the reply:

        * Run background tasks like:

            * Adding the message and reply to the session history.
            * Updating token usage.
            * Logging the chat.
            * Queuing user and chat updates for MongoDB.
